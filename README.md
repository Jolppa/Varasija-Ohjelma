# Varasija-Ohjelma

My first real project, that fetches my position in the queue from Opintopolku.fi and scrapes a .xlsb file, that shows how many positions are still available in the school I'm trying to get in. It's really clumpsy and not as pretty as I would like, but it does the job (most of the times).

Usage:
1. run command 'npm install'
2. run command 'npm run demo'
3. open your browser and connect to localhost:3000
